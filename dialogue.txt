several lines have casual/ formal versions together

if there are multiple possible lines in a category, as far as I can tell they are chosen at random

the casual or formal version of the line will be used depending on the character's relationship with the target, but the line will otherwise be the set once your turn starts

this means using save states will not work to produce different lines from the same category even if the target is changed (casual/ formal not withstanding)

section 2: lines 1510 - 1648 (game end quote)
win L - 1 line
lose L - 1 line
win Kira - 1 line
lose Kira - 1 line
win L successful investigation - 1 line
win Kira no Death Note - 1 line
win Kira Death Note - 1 line
(I'm not entirely sure about the Kira win quotes. You may be able to use the Death Note then vote L out and still get the 'no Death Note' quote. I'm guessing the different win quotes without the Death Note depend on whether you also voted L or not, but I haven't confirmed it.)

section 3: lines 1649 - 1781 (Out by vote or judgement)
voted out - 1 line
voted out Kira - 1 line
voted out not Kira - 1 line
voted out L - 1 line
judged - 1 line
judged L - 1 line
judged not L - 1 line
(I believe it always uses the 'voted out' or 'judged' line then uses another depending on your role.)

section 4: lines 4159 - 4557 (vote, investigation, Death Note selection)
2 lines
investigation select - 1 line
investigation confirm - 1 line
